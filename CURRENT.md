# CURRENT — living product focus

**Only session handoff.** Update when priority, next slice, or known runtime
state changes. Read after `AGENTS.md`. Full model:
[`docs/progress-model.md`](docs/progress-model.md). Capability maturity:
[`docs/capabilities.md`](docs/capabilities.md).

**Decisions agents must ask about:**  
[`docs/open-questions.md` § Decision points](docs/open-questions.md#decision-points-ask-human).
Do not invent product policy.

**As of:** 2026-08-12 (browser passkey get dogfooded on Google; vault unlock OK)

## Now

1. **Browser (CEF) — engine polish next**  
   - Branch: **`naturalethic/cef-browser`** (this worktree).  
   - Single crate `sola-browser`: iced chrome + CEF CPU OSR.  
   - **Dogfood (local):** multipage/chrome + tab switch solid; Profiles
     menubar (in-process switch — window stays); Bitwarden unlock (prefer
     **`--release` install**); fill after unlock; **passkey get()** on
     Google; cold start blank tab.  
   - Manual: `docs/manual/sola-browser.md`.  
   - **Not shipped:** passkey **registration**; loading/history flags from
     CEF; input/scroll / OSR polish.  
   - **Next (unordered):** loading/history flags from CEF; input/scroll
     polish; deeper OSR quirks; passkey create if needed.  
2. **sola-arcade / windowed gamescope** — **partial, dogfoodable** (on master)  
   - Backlog: Portal-class nest fails; residual flicker; title contrast;
     never-played owned without API.  
3. **Distribution follow-through (when resumed)** — ISO e2e, TZ, tarball.  
4. **Follow-ups (unordered backlog):** float chrome, D1/D2, preview, mail,
   kvm clipboard, switcher FFM holdoff (`naturalethic/switcher-ffm-holdoff`
   unmerged), etc.

**Explicit holds:** none.

**Always allowed:** pure safety/doc fixes; tests; progress-doc maintenance;
warning cleanups; worktree hygiene the user asks for.

## Known dogfood state

| | **primary (local)** | **dist (QEMU)** |
|--|---------------------|-----------------|
| Role | Daily dogfood desktop | Installer / image engineering |
| Launch | Physical TTY → `/opt/sola/bin/sola` | `cargo make vm run` / `iso run` |
| Install root | `/opt/sola/bin/`, logs `/opt/sola/log/` | Guest image + `var/images/` products |
| Bus / UI | sticky `~/.config/sola/state.toml`; Iced + kit | Same stack inside guest when installed |
| Dist path | Shape 1 colleague module (`INSTALL.md`) | QEMU **vdb** install → loginless Sola **OK**; **ISO e2e pending** |
| Branch | **`naturalethic/cef-browser`** (browser); master for other daily | Feature work in worktrees / Orca workspaces |
| Browser | Single-crate CEF; chrome + tab switch + Profiles solid; Bitwarden unlock + fill after unlock; passkey **get** dogfooded (Google) with release install | — |
| Arcade | Banner list + nest dogfooded (Core Keeper, PEAK); cache + ready-to-play filter + lazy banners; nest Steam exits on game quit; some titles still flaky | — |
| Nest paint | wayland+`-b`+`-S fit`; **no `-e`**; `--nested-steam` (no BPM) | — |

**Install policy:** agents never run `cargo make install` without explicit
permission for that install. User installs and smokes.

**Useful:**

```bash
cargo make build
cargo make install browser shell   # only with your OK
RUST_LOG=debug /opt/sola/bin/sola 2>&1 | tee /opt/sola/log/sola.log
```

## Locked models (do not re-litigate)

| Topic | Rule |
|-------|------|
| UI stack | **Iced + sola-kit** only for new apps; WebView host is apocrypha |
| Compositor | **River** external; **sola-river** is the bus ↔ Wayland bridge |
| IPC | **Sola Bus** (Unix socket events) + Wayland for surfaces/input |
| Process model | Multi-process; each app independently restartable |
| Theme | Bus `Topic::Theme` + kit semantic tokens/fonts; shell chrome tokens |
| Browser | **CEF** in single `sola-browser` crate; no `accelerated_osr`; WPE path retired |
| Agent backend | Attach to **shared Grok leader** — do not spawn private turn-loop agents |
| Gamescope host | Windowed only (`-W`/`-H`, never host `-f`); product path is Arcade nest |
